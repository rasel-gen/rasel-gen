# Asaduzzaman Rasel

**Full Stack Developer & Blockchain Engineer** — Co-founder & CTO, **NexusLab** • Founder, **KwikCommerz**

I build **Blockchain** (EVMs—Ethereum, BSC, TRON, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base; **Solana**; **Sui**), **SaaS**, **AI**, **Social Platforms**, and **Telegram Mini Apps/Bots**. I ship products that work on day 1—and still work on day 1000.

---

## TL;DR
- **Blockchain:** EVMs (Ethereum, BSC, TRON, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base), **Solana**, **Sui** — Launchpads, Tokenomics, Smart Contracts, Exchanges, NFT Markets, Staking, **Custom Chains/L2s**.
- **Full Stack (Web/SaaS):** Founder of **KwikCommerz** (multi-tenant e-commerce) — subscriptions, payments, analytics, admin ops.
- **AI:** **IXCoach** (AI-driven coaching), image generation + monetization, **agentic AI** (tool use, RAG, evaluators, safety).
- **Social:** TikTok-style short-video platform (video pipeline, feeds, moderation, growth).
- **Telegram:** Mini Apps & Bots (wallets, token creation/launch, AI automations, tap-to-earn).
- **Automation:** AI content writing, scheduling, and **cross-posting** to socials (X, LinkedIn, etc.) with analytics.
- **Infra:** **Docker/Kubernetes**, CI/CD, observability on **AWS & DigitalOcean**.

## What I Build

### Blockchain (EVMs, Solana, Sui)
- **Launchpads & Tokenomics:** creator journeys, vesting/locks, liquidity bootstrapping, dashboards.
- **Smart Contracts:** ERC-20/721/1155, staking vaults, AMM/DEX components, NFT mints/marketplaces.
- **Exchanges:** order flow, indexers, price caches, wallet UX, custody flows.
- **Custom Chains / L2s:** validator/PoS ops, node orchestration, RPC/indexers, gas/fee strategy.

### SaaS & Web Platforms
- **KwikCommerz (Founder):** multi-tenant e-commerce — stores, catalog, checkout, subscriptions, coupons, tax/shipping, analytics.
- Architecture: domain-driven design, clean APIs, queues/jobs, usage metering, billing, admin tooling.

### AI Products
- **IXCoach (AI-driven coaching):** session memory, safe prompting, evaluator-in-the-loop quality checks, and growth-friendly onboarding.
- **Image Generation + Monetization:** credits, creator payouts, safety filters, CDN pipelines, anti-abuse.
- **Agentic Systems & Social Media Automation:**  
  - AI content ideation → drafting → rewriting → hashtags/captions  
  - Scheduling calendar & queues; approval workflows  
  - **Cross-posting** to X/Twitter, LinkedIn (and others as needed)  
  - Auto-threading, link previews, UTM tagging, media pipelines  
  - Rate-limit–aware posting, retries, webhooks, analytics dashboards

### Social Platforms
- **Short-form video:** ingestion/transcoding, ranking feeds, comments/likes, notifications, moderation (hashing/heuristics), creator analytics.
- Growth systems: referrals, quests, badges, rate-limited APIs, antifraud heuristics.

### Telegram Mini Apps & Bots
- Use cases: crypto wallets, token creation/launch, AI automations, tap-to-earn quests, KYC (when required).
- Built-in: secure key handling, abuse prevention, rate limits, real-time events, analytics.

## Selected Highlights
- **AI life-coaching platform:** reduced therapy costs by ~**60%**, increased accessibility by ~**300%**, served **100k+ users** in year one.  
- **Consensus R&D — “Proof of Time”:** increased throughput by ~**200%** vs. PoW and reduced energy usage by ~**85%** (research/experimental).  
- **AI code review assistant:** GPT-based analysis cut manual review time by ~**70%** and caught **~45%** more potential bugs pre-deploy.  
- **Fintech microservices:** designed for **10k TPS** with **99.999%** uptime through SRE/observability and careful failure isolation.
