🚀 **About Me:**

Hello, World! I'm Rasel, not just a full-stack Software Engineer, but a digital alchemist! Currently, I'm conjuring up tech magic as the CTO of [Nexuslab LLC](https://nexuslab.net), and flexing my coding muscles as Lead Software Engineer at Next Ai Labs. When I'm not busy being a tech superhero, I enjoy long walks in the virtual forests of code and brewing fresh batches of algorithms.
